        // primitive: pre-loaded, built into java, also does not take up that much memory
        // int is integer, double is one of the decimal types, char is a single character, boolean is true/false
        // primitive data types start with lowercase
        // short, long and byte all complements of int
        // float is complement of double (deals with how many decimal places)
        // int - whole numbers (positive or negative) - (7 or -9)
        // double - expressed as decimals (positive or negative) - (7.32 or -6.98)
        // char values are always in single quotes - ('A', '7')
        // boolean has only two values - (true or false)
        
        // Object data types - not pre-loaded into java
        // String (not a primitive data type because it is not pre-loaded with Java) - an object in Java is class within java or programmer-creater class
        // anything capitalized is a class object
        // String values are always within double quotes - ("Java")
        // "A" is not 'A'
        
        // variable - storage location, memory allocation
        // FIVE PARTS TO VARIABLE DECLARATION/INITIALIZATION:
            // 1 - the data type
            // 2 - the identifier
            // 3 - the assignment operator (=)
            // 4 - the actual value
            // 5 - semicolon to mark the end of the statement
        String name = "Pranav Abbaraju";
        // 1.   2.  3.        4.       5.
        
        
        // constants - like variables but cannot be changed
        // add 'final' and identifier has to be all CAPS
        
        //QUIZ REVIEW:
        //1. How many primitive data types are preloaded in java?
        //2. Give the one Object data type that will be used greatly in this class
        //3. Give an example of each of the data types
        //4. What are the five things neede to declare and initialize a variable in Java?
        //5. What does printf allow you to do to your output?
