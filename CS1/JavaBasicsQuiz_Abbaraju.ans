1. .java
2. A project folder must be created (src).
3. a.The source code is compiled into byte code, then it is translated into machine language (two-step process), b. A compiler takes the entire code and converts it, whereas an interpretor like in python, translates line by line. That's why a compiler lists out all errors instead of stopping at the first one.
4. The class name must be identical to the file name in Java, and both must be capitalized.
5. a. method, b. variable, c. class
6. The main method is missing. There should be a "public static void main(String[] args){" inside of the class, along with another closing curly brace.
7. The main method is missing the 'void' in it.
8. The print method is incorrect; it should be "System.out.println();"
9. There should be a semicolon at the end of the print method.
10.The BasicsQuiz class should not be indented.
