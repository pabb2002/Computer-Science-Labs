# Outputs
print "I eat food.", # Comma is used for listing out values
print "I eat too much!" 
print "Here is a number:", 9, "I love numbers"
# Casting: changing between types
# Ex: "mom", int("65")

# Escape sequences
print "\rMy favorite \r\rcolor is green" # \r is a return sequence
print "It's \\rhard to know \nwhat is going on" 
# \n is a new line 
# \\ is how to put a single \ into a str as a character
print "My math teacher says, \"Math is cool\"" 
# use backslashes to include quotes

# Naming Conventions
# 1student, one_student, oneStudent!
# 1student = "Pranav"
# print 1student (this is WRONG; variables cannot start with numbers)
one_student = "Pranav"
print one_student
oneStudent = "Pranav"
print oneStudent
# one Student = "Pranav"
# print one Student (this is WRONG; no spaces in variable names)
